# UFOs
## Project Background
Dana's goal is to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings. So, she essentially needs to build two things:
- The webpage that will allow users to view the data (HTML);
- A dynamic table that will present it (JavaScript).
Dana will switch between building the JavaScript table (within the app.js file) and the HTML page (within an index.html file).
